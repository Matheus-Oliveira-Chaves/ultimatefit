## Setup

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command in each respective /ultimatefit and ultimatefit/backend directories to install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 2. Run Webpack Development Server (Frontend)

To start the Webpack development server for the frontend, use the following command:

```sh
cd ultimatefit
npm start
```

This will launch the frontend application and make it accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

### 3. Run Backend Server

Before running the backend server, make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured.

Start PostgreSQL:

```sh
startpostgres
```

## Creating The DB

Use the `psql -U labber` command to login to the PostgreSQL server with the username `labber` and the password `labber`. This command **MUST** be run in a vagrant terminal, we are using the PostgreSQL installation provided in the vagrant environment. M1/M2 and WSL2 users can execute this command in their terminal.

Create a database with the command `CREATE DATABASE ultimatefit;`.

## Seeding

Run a \i backend/migration/schema.sql;

This command will seed the database with their tables.

## Run The Server

Run the following command to start the backend server:

```sh
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend server will be running at http://localhost:5000 by default.

Now, you have both the frontend and backend servers up and running. You can access the UltimateFit application in your web browser.

Enjoy using UltimateFit!
